		This page consists of reporting the situation that is being
		living in Mexico and the actions that we should put in
		practice to become a developed country.
		<br>
		<br>
		It is very important that people realize all
		the situations that happen in our country, since sometimes
		we do not realize the changes and surpasses that there are.
		<br>
		<br>
		Thanks to this information that is presented, we need
		that people become aware of the situation in which
		we are living and that we put into practice our
		knowledge and skills to be able to convert our
		country in a better place.

		The actions that we must follow to transform our
		country in a better developed:
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		1) Reduce taxes on gasoline and diesel for
		avoid increases in public transport and products
		basic
		<br>
		<br>
		2) Build new refineries, because the ones we have are
		obsolete If we produce our own gasoline, it will be
		cheaper.
		<br>
		<br>
		3) Make public oil revenues to know
		how much is produced and how this money is spent.
		<br>
		<br>
		4) Betting on the use of railways to move
		merchandise and passengers. This will produce costs of
		transport and will promote tourism.
		<br>
		<br>
		5) Implement a strategy to avoid the exit of
		investments of the country. If Donald Trump presses
		companies not to establish themselves in Mexico, we must
		show that we have the talent so that even
		invest more here.
		<br>
		<br>
		6) Reduce the salary of the president, governors
		secretaries of state, deputies, senators, and seniors
		officials, in addition to the pensions of former
		Presidents The saved would not represent much,
		but it is not possible that we have officials who
		earn in a month, more than a house of
		social interest that Mexicans are slow to pay
		more than 20 years
		<br>
		<br>
		7) Eliminate advertising expenses, events and ceremonies
		government, as well as land and air transport of
		officials. Also, cut the allocation of
		resources for political parties and their campaigns.
		<br>
		<br>
		8) Effectively fight corruption and impunity.
		we must enforce the law to confront and punish
		the corrupt, regardless of who they are or the
		since it has.
		<br>
		<br>
		9) Invest well in education to have a society
		more and better educated that requires better governments and
		Strengthen our democracy. Education is the best
		weapon to fight the problems of Mexico.
		<br>
		<br>
		10) Address inequality, the origin of all
		our ills We are an unequal country because 1% of
		Mexicans have 21% of income and wealth
		of the four richest men in Mexico is equivalent to
		four times what the 32 states of the
		Republic for infrastructure in 2017. It is urgent to review
		our economic model.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		These are our proposals to be able to change the
		reality of the country and make it effort, talent and
		dedication of each one what marks our destiny in
		life, and not where, or how we were born.
